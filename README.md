# Semantic Segmentation of High-Voltage Power Line Insulators

---

High-voltage power lines are the backbone of modern infrastructure. Keeping them operational and safe depends heavily on insulators — the components that prevent current from leaking from conductors to towers or surrounding environments. But insulators can accumulate dirt, suffer cracks, or degrade over time, increasing the risk of electrical failures and power outages.

Traditionally, inspecting insulators has required teams of workers climbing tall towers or using drones to capture images. It’s dangerous, expensive, and time-consuming. That’s where deep learning can help.

This project focuses on **semantic segmentation** of power line insulators in images. By isolating insulators at the pixel level, we pave the way for systems that can automatically detect damage, dirt, or other faults.

## Highlights

- Developed deep learning models to segment insulators at pixel level.
- Leveraged a synthetic dataset due to the scarcity of real-world annotated data.
- Tested several architectures including U-Net, LinkNet, and PSPNet.
- Achieved a Dice Coefficient of 0.9803 using LinkNet with a VGG19 backbone.
- Outperforms the previous best-reported Dice score of 0.95 for this dataset, representing roughly a 3.19% improvement.

## Why Synthetic Data?

A key challenge in this project was the lack of real-world images of high-voltage insulators with pixel-level annotations. To address this, we have used synthetic data generated by using tools like Autodesk, Blender, Unity, SolidWorks, and Inventor.

These synthetic images include:

- Glass, porcelain, and polymer insulators.
- Varied backgrounds such as mountains, forests, deserts, cities, rivers, and plantations.
- Both “clean” and “dirty” insulator images (this project focuses on clean ones for segmentation).

Synthetic data allowed us to build and train segmentation models capable of identifying insulators under diverse conditions.

## The Dataset

Here’s a snapshot of the dataset:

- **Total clean images (after filtering):** 44,655
  - Glass insulators: 13,135 images
  - Porcelain insulators: 15,759 images
  - Polymer insulators: 15,761 images
- Each image comes with a binary mask labeling the insulator’s pixels.
- Additional “dirty” images exist for contamination classification (future work).

## Our Approach

We explored several popular segmentation architectures:

- U-Net with ResNet-34 and ResNet-50 backbones
- LinkNet with VGG16 and VGG19 backbones
- PSPNet with ResNet-50 backbone

After extensive experiments, **LinkNet with a VGG19 backbone** delivered the best results:

| Metric               | Value    |
|----------------------|----------|
| Dice Coefficient     | 0.9803   |
| Jaccard Index (IoU)  | 0.9626   |
| Accuracy             | 0.9972   |

This surpasses the previous best Dice score of 0.95 reported for this dataset, an improvement of about 3.19%.

## Tools used to Train the Model

Python 3.9 and Pytorch 2.5.1 has been used for coding.

## Grad-CAM Analysis

To better understand what parts of the image influence the model’s predictions, we performed Grad-CAM analysis. The heatmap highlights areas that contributed most to the segmentation decision.

## Future Work

There’s plenty of room to build on this project:

- Extend the pipeline to handle dirty insulator images.
- Implement a contamination classification model.
- Collect real-world insulator images for training and testing.
- Deploy models on drones (UAVs) for live inspections.
